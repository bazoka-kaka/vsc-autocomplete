- search for user snippets 
- select your language
(you can select the global snippets)
- just uncomment the example 
- change it to your preference

example:
{
  // Place your snippets for php here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
  // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
  // same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "Print to console": {
    "prefix": ".br",
    "body": [".'<br>'", "$1"],
    "description": "Concat html break"
  },
  "Dump": {
    "prefix": "dump",
    "body": ["echo '<pre>';\nvar_dump($1);\necho '</pre>';$2"],
    "description": "Output array"
  }
}

note:
we can do "\n" to go to the next line 
you can also do "\t" for going to the next tab 
$1 --> this is where you wanna go first 
$2 --> this is where you wanna go after pressing tab
